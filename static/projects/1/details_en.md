# GameHub

**GameHub** is a collaborative web platform for playing modern board games online (*Agent Trouble*, *Insider*). It allows players who are geographically apart to enjoy an experience close to playing in person, thanks to:  
- Interactive lobby to create or join a game  
- Automatic role assignment  
- Dynamic display of cards and boards  

Designed from the start to be **modular**, the platform is regularly updated with new games.  

## Technologies & Architecture
- **Backend**: Python 3.12 + Flask  
- **Database**: SQLite for managing games, players, and roles  
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (vanilla) + Jinja2  
- **Modularity**: each game has its own assets and logic, making it easy to add new games  

## My Role
- Full-stack development (Flask routes, database management, front-end templates)  
- Design of the lobby and integration of resources (images, rules)  
- Implementation of a modular architecture to easily add new games  

## Highlights & Learnings
- Complete management of game states and immersive user experience  
- Securing the administrator system and deployment on a personal server  
- Future improvements: real-time communication (WebSockets), automated testing, CI/CD, migration to Postgres
